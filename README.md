# Sample project for a web page
This page provides an example of how you to structure a standard web site.
The standard followed here aligns to Next.js convention. With the folder names being the name we use when importing.

To achieve this we are providing a index.js files inside every folder (webpack is looking for this, unless given a specific filename).
We have also setup a jsconfig.json to enable us to use absolute paths when importing rather than having to use relative paths.
